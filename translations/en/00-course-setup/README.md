# Course Setup

## Introduction

This lesson will guide you on how to run the code samples provided in this course.

## Connect with Other Learners and Get Support

Before cloning the repository, join the [AI Agents For Beginners Discord channel](https://aka.ms/ai-agents/discord) to get help with setup, ask questions about the course, or connect with other learners.

## Clone or Fork this Repository

Start by cloning or forking the GitHub repository. This will create your own version of the course materials, allowing you to run, test, and modify the code.

You can do this by clicking the link to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners/fork" target="_blank">fork the repository</a>.

Afterward, you should have your own forked version of the course at the following link:

![Forked Repo](../../../translated_images/forked-repo.33f27ca1901baa6a5e13ec3eb1f0ddd3a44d936d91cc8cfb19bfdb9688bd2c3d.en.png)

## Running the Code

This course includes a series of Jupyter Notebooks that provide hands-on experience in building AI Agents.

The code samples use one of the following:

**Requires GitHub Account - Free**:

1) Semantic Kernel Agent Framework + GitHub Models Marketplace (labeled as `semantic-kernel.ipynb`)
2) AutoGen Framework + GitHub Models Marketplace (labeled as `autogen.ipynb`)

**Requires Azure Subscription**:
3) Azure AI Foundry + Azure AI Agent Service (labeled as `azureaiagent.ipynb`)

We recommend trying all three types of examples to determine which works best for you.

Your choice will dictate the setup steps you need to follow below.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
  - **NOTE**: If Python 3.12 is not installed, make sure to install it. Then create your virtual environment using Python 3.12 to ensure the correct versions are installed from the `requirements.txt` file.
  
    > Example

    Create a Python virtual environment directory:

    ``` bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    Then activate the virtual environment:

    macOS and Linux

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
  
    Windows

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- A GitHub Account - For access to the GitHub Models Marketplace
- Azure Subscription - For access to Azure AI Foundry
- Azure AI Foundry Account - For access to the Azure AI Agent Service

A `requirements.txt` file is included in the root of this repository, listing all the necessary Python packages to run the code samples.

Install them by running the following command in your terminal at the root of the repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


We recommend creating a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts and issues.

## Setup VSCode
Ensure you are using the correct Python version in VSCode.

## Set Up for Samples Using GitHub Models 

### Step 1: Retrieve Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

This course uses the GitHub Models Marketplace, which provides free access to Large Language Models (LLMs) for building AI Agents.

To use GitHub Models, you need to create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

You can do this by visiting your <a href="https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens" target="_blank">Personal Access Tokens settings</a> in your GitHub account.

Follow the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-to-code/storing-your-secrets-safely) when creating your token. Only grant the permissions necessary to run the code samples in this course.

1. Select the `Fine-grained tokens` option on the left side of your screen under **Developer settings**.
   ![](../../../translated_images/profile_developer_settings.410a859fe749c755c859d414294c5908e307222b2c61819c3203bbeed4470e25.en.png)

    Then click `Generate new token`.

    ![Generate Token](../../../translated_images/fga_new_token.1c1a234afe202ab37483944a291ee80c1868e1e78082fd6bd4180fea5d5a15b4.en.png)

2. Provide a descriptive name for your token that reflects its purpose, making it easier to identify later.

    🔐 Token Duration Recommendation

    Recommended duration: 30 days  
    For enhanced security, you can opt for a shorter duration—such as 7 days 🛡️.  
    This is a great way to set a personal goal and complete the course while maintaining your learning momentum 🚀.

    ![Token Name and Expiration](../../../translated_images/token-name-expiry-date.a095fb0de63868640a4c82d6b1bbc92b482930a663917a5983a3c7cd1ef86b77.en.png)

3. Limit the token's scope to your fork of this repository.

    ![Limit scope to fork repository](../../../translated_images/token_repository_limit.924ade5e11d9d8bb6cd21293987e4579dea860e2ba66d607fb46e49524d53644.en.png)

4. Restrict the token's permissions: Under **Permissions**, click the **Account** tab, then click the "+ Add permissions" button. A dropdown will appear. Search for **Models** and check the box for it.
    ![Add Models Permission](../../../translated_images/add_models_permissions.c0c44ed8b40fc143dc87792da9097d715b7de938354e8f771d65416ecc7816b8.en.png)

5. Verify the required permissions before generating the token. ![Verify Permissions](../../../translated_images/verify_permissions.06bd9e43987a8b219f171bbcf519e45ababae35b844f5e9757e10afcb619b936.en.png)

6. Before generating the token, ensure you are ready to store it securely, such as in a password manager vault, as it will not be displayed again after creation. ![Store Token Securely](../../../translated_images/store_token_securely.08ee2274c6ad6caf3482f1cd1bad7ca3fdca1ce737bc485bfa6499c84297c789.en.png)

Copy the newly created token. You will add this to your `.env` file included in this course.

### Step 2: Create Your `.env` File

To create your `.env` file, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


This will copy the example file and create a `.env` file in your directory, where you can fill in the values for the environment variables.

Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and paste your token into the `GITHUB_TOKEN` field.
![GitHub Token Field](../../../translated_images/github_token_field.20491ed3224b5f4ab24d10ced7a68c4aba2948fe8999cfc8675edaa16f5e5681.en.png)

You should now be able to run the code samples provided in this course.

## Set Up for Samples Using Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Agent Service

### Step 1: Retrieve Your Azure Project Endpoint

Follow the steps for creating a hub and project in Azure AI Foundry as outlined here: [Hub resources overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/ai-resources).

Once your project is created, retrieve the connection string for your project.

You can find this on the **Overview** page of your project in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

![Project Connection String](../../../translated_images/project-endpoint.8cf04c9975bbfbf18f6447a599550edb052e52264fb7124d04a12e6175e330a5.en.png)

### Step 2: Create Your `.env` File

To create your `.env` file, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


This will copy the example file and create a `.env` file in your directory, where you can fill in the values for the environment variables.

Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and paste your token into the `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` field.

### Step 3: Sign in to Azure

As a security best practice, use [keyless authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/ai/keyless-connections?tabs=csharp%2Cazure-cli?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) to authenticate to Azure OpenAI with Microsoft Entra ID.

Open a terminal and run `az login --use-device-code` to sign in to your Azure account.

After logging in, select your subscription in the terminal.

## Additional Environment Variables - Azure Search and Azure OpenAI 

For the Agentic RAG Lesson (Lesson 5), some samples use Azure Search and Azure OpenAI.

To run these samples, add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

### Overview Page (Project)

- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - Found under **Project details** on the **Overview** page of your project.
- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_NAME` - Located at the top of the **Overview** page for your project.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE` - Found in the **Included capabilities** tab for **Azure OpenAI Service** on the **Overview** page.

### Management Center

- `AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_GROUP` - Found under **Project properties** on the **Overview** page of the **Management Center**.
- `GLOBAL_LLM_SERVICE` - Found under **Connected resources**. If not listed, check the **Azure portal** under your resource group for the AI Services resource name.

### Models + Endpoints Page

- `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - Select your embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) and note the **Deployment name** from the model details.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - Select your chat model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) and note the **Deployment name** from the model details.

### Azure Portal

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Found under **Azure AI services**, click on it, then go to **Resource Management**, **Keys and Endpoint**, and scroll down to "Azure OpenAI endpoints" to copy the "Language APIs" endpoint.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - From the same screen, copy KEY 1 or KEY 2.
- `AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` - Found under **Azure AI Search** resource in the **Overview** section.
- `AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY` - Found under **Settings**, then **Keys**, where you can copy the primary or secondary admin key.

### External Webpage

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` - Found on the [API version lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/api-version-deprecation#latest-ga-api-release) page under **Latest GA API release**.

### Setup Keyless Authentication

Instead of hardcoding credentials, use a keyless connection with Azure OpenAI. Import `DefaultAzureCredential` and call the `DefaultAzureCredential` function to retrieve the credential.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, InteractiveBrowserCredential
```
